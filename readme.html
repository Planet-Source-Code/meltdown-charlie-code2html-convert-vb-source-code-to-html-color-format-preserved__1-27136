<h3> Converts VB source code to color formatted HTML</h3>
Code2HTML.bas - is a VB source code module that you can use to format raw source code text into HTML. Code2HTML preserves the tab layout of your source and also attempts to color code it ala the  VB IDE.<br>

You may freely use this code in your own projects so long as you acknowledge the origins of it by including a credit somewhere in either your documentation, about box ...<br>
Of course I can't stand over you with a big stick to enforce this, but it's not cool to use without quoting your sources...<br><br>
If you improve the code I would appreciate it if you posted me a copy at <a class="Normal" href="mailto:mferris@zfree.co.nz">mferris@zfree.co.nz</a>. Also don't forget to visit my site at <a class="Normal" href="http://www.intactinteractive.com">www.intactinteractive.com</a> for more source code and other stuff...<Br>
